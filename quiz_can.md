Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz
Polymorphism
What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
A: As the name implies (poly=many, morph=form) it is the ability of an object to assume another form for a limited purpose.


What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
A: An object of a class may share very similar methods with other objects of other classes. To ensure a methodological unity throughout the system, we assign interfaces to these classes. By doing that we can create collection of different classes under one "interface" banner, or use the methods that's been assigned in their declaration to provide similar responses.

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
Interfaces.

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
As much as we like.

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
A hotel's HVAC system can adjust AC settings of various rooms and halls. These halls can be instantiated as different objects of different classes. If HVAC adjustments are implemented to this system, each room now can have an IACable interface to access their AC settings.

Composition
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?


When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed?
